///                   call can never succeed; the caller skips the stroke.
///   - INVALID_STATE the layer's backing resources are absent (construction
///                   or resize failed earlier, or the handle was torn down).
///                   Not retryable as-is; the caller's normal layer
///                   (re)construction path is the recovery.
///   - TRANSIENT     a momentary resource failure inside the dispatch
///                   (upload-buffer allocation, command-buffer begin/submit
///                   hiccup). The layer and shader handles are still healthy:
///                   retrying the SAME handles next frame is expected to
///                   succeed. Callers must NOT tear down / rebuild the ink
///                   resource chain — that would amplify a one-frame hiccup
///                   into a rebuild storm.
///   - STALE_CONTEXT the device generation behind the handles is gone or
///                   inconsistent (device-lost latch, or bitmap and shader
///                   baked on different generations). Retrying the same
